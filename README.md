Created a food delivery app template in Figma, the steps I follwed are below.

1.Set Up Your Frame: Start by selecting a mobile frame, like iPhone 14 Pro Max, to serve as your app's canvas.

2.Design Wireframes: Outline the app's structure with wireframes, including key screens like Take a look, menu bar, food categories,meal details, and cart.

3.Add UI Elements: Incorporate logos, icons, images, and a color palette to enhance the aesthetic. Use a layout grid for alignment.
